\section{Rings}
Rings are a particular kind of algebraic structure.\\
What is the point in considering ``algebraic structures''?\\
Algebraic structures are abstractions that clarify some essential feature of a problem, and provide a language to describe issues and how they may be resolved.\\
\\
Rings ``come from'' groups.\\
Groups are in some sense the simplest kind of abstract algebraic structures.\\
Groups are however, already \underline{very} hard structures to understand.\\
However groups simply cannot capture many objects we come about, which fundamentally may have more than one operation.\\
From a group $G=(G,\ast)$ we can always form a ring called the \underline{group-ring}.\\
\defn{Ring}{
    A sert $\mathcal{R}$ together with two binary operations $``+''$ and $``\times''$ such that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $(\mathcal{R},+)$ is an Abelian group;
        \item $\times$ is associative;
        \item $a\times(b+c)=a\times b + a\times c,$ $\forall a,b,c\in \mathcal{R}$\\;
              $(b+c)\times a=b\times a + c\times a$ $\forall a,b,c\in \mathcal{R}$\\;
    \end{enumerate}
    forms a ring $\mathcal{R}=(\mathcal{R},+,\times)$.\\
    A ring with a multiplicative identity $1_\mathcal{R}$ such that $1_\mathcal{R}\times a=a\times1_\mathcal{R}=a$ is called a \underline{unital} ring.
}
\ex{
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $(\Z,+,\times)$ is a unital ring,
        \item $(2\Z,+,\times)$ is a ring, but it is not a unital ring.
    \end{enumerate}
    Both are examples of \underline{commutative} rings, because $\times$ commutes in both cases.
}
\newpage
\ex{
    $
        M_{2\times2}(\Z)=\left\{ \begin{bmatrix}
            1&b\\c&d
        \end{bmatrix}: a,b,c,d\in\Z \right\}
    $
    with respect to matrix adidtion and multiplication is a non-commutative ring.
}
The jury is out on whether non-commutative rings are important. Heavily context dependant.
